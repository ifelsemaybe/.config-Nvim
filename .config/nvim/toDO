- Add debugers for the languages you want to use (Python, C/C++, C#, Java, JS/TS)

- Make it so that when I press <leader>q whilst nvim-tree is selected, it closes nvim 

- When in insert, cursor is hidden behind vertical indent lines

- Install Plugins:

    -A : colorizer

    -B : bufferline (could replace barbar plugin)

- Make holding Shift access Visual Mode and releasing it close Visual Mode. Make this command accessible from both insert and normal modes. 

- Make a certain directory remember the buffers you had last opened, and have them open once you open once you do nvim . 

-Color Scheme: 

    -B : Make moonfly your dark theme and belafonte day your light theme! Would be cool to switch between them as the day passes to night and vice versa.
