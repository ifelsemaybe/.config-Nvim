- Make it so that when I press <leader>q whilst nvim-tree is selected, it closes nvim 

- When in insert, cursor is hidden behind vertical indent lines. I fixed it temporaly with option cursorline = true.
  Would need a function that detects its scope and reverses the cursor's color for a less naive fix.

-I've noticed when I autocomplete it indents by 2spaces, see if I can switch it to 4 to match my tab indents.

- Install Plugins:

    -A : bufferline (could replace barbar plugin)

-Color Scheme: 

   -A : Make moonfly your dark theme and belafonte day your light theme! Would be cool to switch between them as the day passes to night and vice versa.

-When you click space (in Insert) after a line which is a comment, it tries to autocomplete another comment. It is annoying.
